# Lending

Buying fyDAI of any maturity with DAI can be thought of as lending DAI at a fixed rate.

The discount you receive from the face value of the fyDAI locks in a fixed return that can be calculated based on the time to maturity. 

For example, if you buy 100 yDAI-DEC-20 for 98.8 DAI on September 31, 2020, you will earn an implied rate of interest of 5% APR.

You can also exit your position early by selling your yDAI for DAI. Because yDAI is traded freely, changes in 
interest rates may affect the amount of DAI you receive when redeeming early.

Typically, you should be able to buy 1 yDAI for less than 1 DAI because DeFi interest rates are positive. In a hypothetical
negative interest rate regime in DeFi, 1 fyDAI would be worth more than 1 DAI!

## Maturity

If you own fyDAI after maturity, you will start to earn the DAI Savings Rate on your fyDAI, until you decide to redeem it for DAI.
