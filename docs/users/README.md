# User Documentation

The Yield UI is available at https://app.yield.is.

We have abstracted away the entirety of our fyTokens, so that you only need to think about
what matters! How much ETH or DAI you need to put in and what your interest rate or yield will be.

There are several fyDAI maturies you can choose. Think of these similarly to USD Treasury maturities.
A fyDAI with maturity at December 31st 2020 may be converted to DAI after December 31st 2020. Until then,
it may trade freely in the market.

Yield Protocol provides 6 maturity dates, listed below. The number was kept small so as to give enough
options for users deciding how long to borrow or lend their Dai, while preserving liquidity in a few concentrated
maturities.

**TODO: Insert all our maturity dates**

As a user you may do the following actions using the Yield Protocol UI:
- **[Borrow](borrowing.md)** DAI against your ETH at fixed interest rates, depending on chosen maturity
- **[Lend](lending.md)** your DAI for fixed yield
- **[Provide liquidity](providing-liquidity.md)** to earn liquidity provider fees
